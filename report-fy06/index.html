        The Perl Maintenance Project: State of the Perl Cow 2006, inspired by
        the <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2006/09/21/onion.html">State of the Onion 10</a> (but not as cool).

<P>

This year we here in the perl project have seen a lot of
<br>
<ul><img border="1" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="growth" align="middle" src="growth.jpg"></ul>
<br>
First we, had 
<br>
<ul><img border="1" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="+$ian" align="middle" src="ian.jpg"></ul>
<br>
followed quickly by
<br>
<ul><img border="1" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="+$yuval" align="middle" src="yuval.jpg"></ul>
<br>
As if that was not enough for us, our lurker cab decided to take the deep plunge.
<br>
More recently, my wife and I added
<br>
<ul><img border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="+$tara" align="middle" src="tara.jpg"></ul>
<br>
but that probably doesn't count in this context.
<P>
esammer and beu showed their heads up this year, and we expect them to be
active members again (if they are by the time I post this, well, that tells
you how long it takes me to post things, doesn't it?)
</p>
<P>
So what have we accomplished? There's the release of g-cpan, which brought
more order to the world - and more bugs.
<br>
<ul><img border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="middle" src="bugs.jpg"></ul>
<br>
No, not those, the other kind, coding bugs.
<P>
Speaking of bugs, we closed <a
href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&long_desc_type=allwordssubstr&long_desc=&bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_file_loc=&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&status_whiteboard=&keywords_type=allwords&keywords=&bug_status=RESOLVED&bug_status=VERIFIED&bug_status=CLOSED&emailassigned_to1=1&emailtype1=exact&email1=perl%40gentoo.org&emailassigned_to2=1&emailtype2=notregexp&email2=mcummings%40gentoo.org&bugidtype=include&bug_id=&chfieldfrom=2005-10-01&chfieldto=2006-09-30&chfieldvalue=&cmdtype=doit&order=Reuse+same+sort+as+last+time&field0-0-0=noop&type0-0-0=noop&value0-0-0=">377 bugs</a> since last September (fiscal year)(if you're government anyway), which given our frequent real lives isn't too shabby.
</P>
<P>
This begs the question: where to next? Well, ian's been working on exporting the perl module portions of g-cpan and other custom apps into an actual Gentoo perl package. I'd like to see g-cpan get on a regular release schedule.  
</p>
<p>I think we need to start focussing efforts on requesting stable requests more than we do, because right now only ~arch users and those that "bug" us get things marked on their platforms. (unless I'm in a sparc/amd64 marking spree)</p>
<p>Beyond that, it's hard to say where we're headed. As a project, our goal has always been the maintenance and viability of the perl code that Gentoo offers. For now, that sums it all up.</p>
